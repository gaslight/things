# Things

This is the client side repo for a small proof of concept app with an angular2
front end and a phoenix backend. You'll need to have the [server](http://github.com/gaslight/thing_server) side app up
and running on port 4000 or else chage app/app.ts accordingly.

To get the client side up and running:

```
npm install -g jspm
npm install -g live-server
jspm install
npm install
live-server
```
